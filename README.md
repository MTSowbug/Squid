[![scopes](https://github.com/Alpaca233/assets/blob/main/Squid/scopes.png)](https://cephla.com/)

The Squid repo provides firmware and software for controlling [Cephla](https://cephla.com/)'s Squid microscope.

Applications include:
- Slide scanning
- Live Cell Imaging
- High Content Screening
- Optical Pooled Screen
- Spatial Omics (with fluidics integration)
- Organoids
- Expansion Microscopy
and more...

## User Interface

## How to Start
### Software
#### Setting up and run Squid software on Linux
Ubuntu 22.04 is the most tested platform. Other Linux systems should work but performance is not guaranteed.

See [README](https://github.com/Cephla-Lab/Squid/blob/master/software/README.md) in `/software` directory for instructions. Toupcam and laser auto-focus camera dependencies will be installed automatically when you run the setup script.

After installation, you can run `python3 /software/tools/script_create_desktop_shortcut.py` to create a shortcut on Desktop.

To run a multipoint acquisition without launching the GUI (headless mode), use
```
python3 software/main_hcs.py --run-acquisition --base-path /path/to/output --experiment-id my_experiment [--coordinates coordinates.csv]
```
This saves data without opening the GUI. Additional options are documented in [software/README.md](software/README.md).
#### Setting up and run Squid software on Windows
See this [post](https://forum.squid-imaging.org/t/setting-up-the-software-on-a-windows-computer/77) on Cephla forum for Windows instructions.

If your Squid has a laser auto-focus module, you will need to install the [driver](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wq0QocIqeD-ZyYgHUPIJ1efOPiPq-fom?usp=sharing) for the laser auto-focus camera and **reboot** the computer. You may also need to install the driver for the main camera you use.

After installation, you can follow this [post](https://forum.squid-imaging.org/t/setting-up-desktop-shortcut-on-a-windows-computer/94) to create a shortcut on Desktop.
#### Setting up Cephla image stitcher
See the [image-stitcher repo](https://github.com/Cephla-Lab/image-stitcher)

#### User manual

New version coming soon!

### Firmware
Usually firmware should be already uploaded to the controller. If you do need to re-upload firmware, you may follow the instructions in this [post](https://forum.squid-imaging.org/t/setting-up-arduino-teensyduino-ide-for-uploading-firmware/36).
